This is a git LFS repository. Before cloning, ensure you have Git LFS installed. Get it here - https://git-lfs.github.com/

Software packages like GitHub Desktop or GitKraken *should* automatically clone all the pointers for LFS files, and then pull the ones you need when you checkout a branch. 

If that doesn't happen, in a terminal enter this:
    `git-lfs fetch`
    
then

    `git-lfs checkout .`

That will pull all LFS files.
